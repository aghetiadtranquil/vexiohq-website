## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Menu is NOT Final
The navigation folder contains exploration documents. The final menu structure needs:
- Fresh brainstorming session
- Clear business priorities
- User journey mapping
- Testing with target audience

### Don't Build Content Yet
Until menu is finalized:
- Don't create extensive content
- Don't implement navigation
- Keep exploring options
- Gather feedback

### Use These Documents As:
- Strategic thinking guides
- Positioning frameworks
- Credibility checklists
- Planning references

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Review** all positioning and credibility docs
2. **Brainstorm** final menu structure with fresh perspective
3. **Decide** on primary business focus
4. **Finalize** navigation approach
5. **Then** implement based on these strategies
