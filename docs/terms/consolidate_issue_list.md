Below is the consolidated issue register deduplicated across ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude, grouped by section, with one conservative decision per issue.

⸻

ISSUE-ID: 01
Section: 1.1 / 8.x (Services description / HRM & Consulting references)
Severity: Critical
Issue Type: Employment
Summary of Risk:
Service descriptions imply operational involvement, recommendations, or execution that could be construed as agency, joint employment, or co-employer status—especially for HR, hiring, or “operational support” use cases (high risk under CA law).
Reviewer Agreement: ChatGPT, Gemini
Conflict (if any): Claude notes absence as “not applicable,” but still flags HR AI liability separately.
Final Decision:
Add an explicit no-employment / no-agency / tool-only positioning clarification tied to AI and HR features, without expanding obligations.

⸻

ISSUE-ID: 02
Section: 1.5 (Intellectual Property Rights)
Severity: Critical
Issue Type: IP
Summary of Risk:
Unclear ownership of AI outputs vs. customer inputs vs. company systems; risk of customers asserting ownership over models, workflows, or derivative improvements; insufficient separation of feedback rights.
Reviewer Agreement: ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude
Conflict (if any): None
Final Decision:
Conceptually separate Customer Inputs, Customer Outputs, and Company Systems/Improvements, and narrow feedback license scope (no new rights granted to customers).

⸻

ISSUE-ID: 03
Section: 8.3 / 8.4 (AI Features – HRM, Expense, Automation)
Severity: Critical
Issue Type: Liability
Summary of Risk:
AI disclaimers are too weak for employment, financial, or operational decision support; exposure to negligent misrepresentation, EEOC/FTC scrutiny, and reliance claims.
Reviewer Agreement: ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude
Conflict (if any): None
Final Decision:
Strengthen no-professional-advice / no-reliance / user verification responsibility framing for AI outputs (conceptual only).

⸻

ISSUE-ID: 04
Section: 5.1 / 3.1 (SMS, Voice, Phone Communications)
Severity: Critical
Issue Type: Other (Regulatory – TCPA)
Summary of Risk:
Bundled or vague consent language risks TCPA class actions; lacks clear opt-in mechanics, revocation clarity, and scope definition.
Reviewer Agreement: Gemini, Claude
Conflict (if any): None
Final Decision:
Conceptually require separate, explicit consent reference and clearer scope/revocation mechanics without adding new marketing rights.

⸻

ISSUE-ID: 05
Section: 5.3 (AI Voice Agents)
Severity: Medium
Issue Type: Liability
Summary of Risk:
“Designed to identify” language may be aspirational; may fail statutory AI disclosure timing requirements (e.g., CA BOT Act).
Reviewer Agreement: Claude
Conflict (if any): Not flagged by others
Final Decision:
Tighten disclosure obligation conceptually (mandatory vs. aspirational) without expanding usage.

⸻

ISSUE-ID: 06
Section: 1.7 (Limitation of Liability)
Severity: Critical
Issue Type: Liability
Summary of Risk:
Liability cap structure ($100 floor / missing carve-outs) risks unconscionability or partial invalidation, exposing company to uncapped liability.
Reviewer Agreement: ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude
Conflict (if any): None
Final Decision:
Align cap conceptually with fees-paid standard and acknowledge legally non-waivable carve-outs (no new exposure assumed).

⸻

ISSUE-ID: 07
Section: 1.6 / 9.4 / 2.4 (Termination & Data Handling)
Severity: Medium
Issue Type: Other
Summary of Risk:
Unilateral termination “for any reason” + inconsistent data retention language creates breach, bad-faith, and data-loss disputes.
Reviewer Agreement: ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude
Conflict (if any): None
Final Decision:
Conceptually harmonize termination discretion with data access/export clarity and internal consistency.

⸻

ISSUE-ID: 08
Section: 1.10 (Governing Law, Arbitration, Class Waiver)
Severity: Critical
Issue Type: Arbitration
Summary of Risk:
Arbitration clause lacks cost allocation, mass-arbitration protection, and venue clarity; class waiver vulnerable without procedural safeguards.
Reviewer Agreement: ChatGPT, Claude
Conflict (if any): Gemini flags venue alignment only
Final Decision:
Add procedural protections (informal resolution / batching / fee clarity) conceptually, without changing dispute forum choice.

⸻

ISSUE-ID: 09
Section: 6.x (Data Processing Agreement & Sub-processors)
Severity: Medium
Issue Type: Other (Privacy)
Summary of Risk:
External or mutable DPA reference without hierarchy; sub-processor objection right lacks consequence; GDPR enforcement ambiguity.
Reviewer Agreement: ChatGPT, Claude
Conflict (if any): None
Final Decision:
Define document hierarchy and consequence of objections conceptually (no expansion of compliance promises).

⸻

ISSUE-ID: 10
Section: 1.1 / 10 (Product-Specific & “Coming Soon” Terms)
Severity: Medium
Issue Type: Other
Summary of Risk:
Including unreleased products in “Services” definition risks immediate breach; product-specific terms may change without assent.
Reviewer Agreement: Gemini, ChatGPT
Conflict (if any): None
Final Decision:
Conceptually distinguish active vs. future/beta products and require assent for material product-specific terms.

⸻

ISSUE-ID: 11
Section: 8.x (Third-Party Platforms)
Severity: Low
Issue Type: Liability
Summary of Risk:
No explicit disclaimer for third-party account bans (LinkedIn, Gmail, etc.) caused by automation usage.

Add conceptual clarification of third-party platform responsibility limits.

⸻

ISSUE-ID: 12
Section: Compliance / Notices (SOC 2, GDPR, Cookies, Opt-out Timing)

Summary of Risk:
Ambiguous “ready” language, missing or inconsistent notices, and opt-out timing discrepancies may create credibility or minor compliance issues.
Reviewer Agreement: Claude, Gemini
Conflict (if any): None
Final Decision:
Normalize terminology and internal consistency without making new compliance claims.
