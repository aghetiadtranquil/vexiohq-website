## 🚨 CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED (Before Launch)

### 1. Blog Post Syntax Errors
**Files to fix:**
- `/src/app/blog/ai-vs-traditional-analytics/page.tsx`
- `/src/app/blog/cost-of-bad-data-quality/page.tsx`

**Issue:** Using `<` and `>` in JSX content
**Fix:** Replace with `&lt;` and `&gt;`

**Example:**
```jsx
// Current (causing error):
<li>□ < $200K → Traditional</li>

// Fix to:
<li>□ &lt; $200K → Traditional</li>
```

### 2. Build Verification
After fixing syntax errors:
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Verify all pages compile
3. Test locally with `npm run dev`
