# PM Taking Direct Action - Solo Implementation

Since other agents cannot run Claude independently, I (PM Agent) will implement critical fixes directly.

## Immediate Actions I'm Taking:

### 1. ✅ COMPLETED: Products Page
- Created comprehensive McKinsey-style products page
- Added value framework, stats, and CTAs
- File: `/src/app/products/page.tsx`

### 2. NEXT: Get Started Page
- Create conversion-focused onboarding page
- Add assessment tool placeholder
- Include clear next steps

### 3. NEXT: Consultation Page  
- Professional consultation request page
- Include calendar booking
- Add qualification questions

### 4. NEXT: About Us Page
- Company story and values
- Team section
- Trust indicators

### 5. NEXT: Fix APIs
- Newsletter subscription endpoint
- Contact form endpoint
- Add validation and error handling

## Current Status:
- Website running on http://localhost:3002
- Products page created with professional content
- Other critical pages still need content
- APIs partially implemented

## Next 30 Minutes:
1. Create Get Started page
2. Create Consultation page
3. Fix newsletter API
4. Test all changes

I'll implement these directly since we cannot spawn multiple Claude instances.
