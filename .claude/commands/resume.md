# Resume Work

Automatically understand where we left off and continue from there.

## Steps:
1. Check SESSION.md for last session's state
2. Review recent git commits and uncommitted changes
3. Check TODO.md for pending tasks
4. Analyze recent file modifications
5. Summarize current state and suggest next steps

This helps maintain continuity across Claude Code sessions.
