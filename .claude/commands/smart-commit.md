# Smart Commit

Intelligent git commit with automatic enhancements.

## What it does:
1. **Groups related changes** intelligently
2. **Generates semantic commit messages**:
   - feat: New features
   - fix: Bug fixes
   - refactor: Code improvements
   - docs: Documentation
   - test: Test changes
   - chore: Maintenance

3. **Auto-includes**:
   - Related test files
   - Updated documentation
   - Config changes

4. **Pre-commit checks**:
   - Runs tests for changed files
   - Fixes linting issues
   - Updates imports

5. **Commit message includes**:
   - What changed
   - Why it changed
   - Breaking changes warning
   - Issue/ticket references

## Usage:
Just say "commit these changes" and it handles everything!

No more "fix typo" or "update stuff" commits!
